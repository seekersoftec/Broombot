Medallion Fund:
Arbitrage -> Mean reversion ( take the mean of prices and check if the market is going up or down, if it is supposed to go up and it went down that might be a good arbitrage opportunity)


Every event has an impact on the market
Connect event to market sentiment
Look for abnormality in market data
Collect as much data with the hopes that a event will happen at least twice..... and find events that are much more likely to happen again.....
