## Requirement

```bash
pandas
pip install pandas
numpy
pip install numpy
OR
install anaconda/miniconda
```

## How to use

Ensure that you already have your dataset downloaded. For this project i used the Oanda API to download historical price.
See [How to Download historical stock/fx prices from oanda](https://github.com/fibai/OANDA-API-WRAPPER/tree/master/HISTORICAL%20PRICES)

```python
After the above process is completed
Run STOCK.py
$ python STOCK.py

Finally run 
$ python Automated_Signla_generator.py

This process initiates every 30mins. You can change the timer as desired.
```
